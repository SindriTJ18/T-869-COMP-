-The processing time for one video frame or image?
The processing time for one video frame is around 1/30 seconds. 
But since the webcam is 30fps the processing time has headroom

-How does the processing time change when you add the bright spot detection?
In my case the processing time did not increase when drawing the framerate nor adding the bright spot detection.
(FPS remained at 30FPS)

-Is the processing time identical when you do not display the image?
Yes the FPS value still hovers around the 30fps mark.

-How does your for-loop implementation compare to the built-in function?
When using my double for loop for only the bright spot detection the processing time increases to around 1/20 sec
on average. 
This method is less efficient than running both the reddest and brightest spot detection at the same
time with the built-in functions.

-Moving your hand in front of the camera, estimate the latency between image capture and display.
I would estimate around 50-100ms

-Is the latency different when capturing from a mobile phone?
Using the app iVCam on my phone, to then stream to my PC the latency difference is not as drastic as i thought.
Maybe around 50ms slower at max?
